# Chicago-Neighborhood-Finder WIP
A CLI tool used to find the Chicago neighborhood you reside in from your address.

To use this tool, paste your Google API key in corresponding spot.

Currently this program takes in data from a CSV file and prints out the corresponding neighborhood.

Current goal: Add a menu and generalize for other cities.
